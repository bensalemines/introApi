                    <h2>Outdoor activities and sports</h2>
                   <p>If you have chosen to spend your holidays in a campsite, it is certainly because you want to enjoy a stay in the great outdoors.
                    You do not want to stay locked up during your stay, but on the contrary, you want to discover new landscapes?
                    To be able to take full advantage of nature, we would advise you to take part in outdoor activities such as those we suggest below.</p>

                    <h2>Evenings around a campfire</h2>
                   <p>This is the essential activity when you want to stay closer to nature. When night falls and the cool finally arrives, gather with your friends or family around the fire.
                    Grilled marshmallows, acoustic guitar session or even stories and tales to tell are all moments that you can share around a campfire.</p>

                    <h2>Ride a bike</h2>
                   <p>Are you worried that the hike will be a bit too strenuous? Instead, opt for exploring the landscapes by bike.
                    You can take your bike or mountain bike (for the most difficult terrain) directly with you on vacation. However, if you do not want to bother with your bikes or if you do not have the necessary equipment to transport them, we advise you to choose a campsite offering bike rental.
                    In this way, you can go for a walk in the region to discover its landscapes.</p>

                    <h2>Football with friends </h2>
                   <p>Can't you imagine spending your holidays without touching football? Football is a sport that can be practiced easily, but it is more pleasant to be able to benefit from a suitable field with at least two goals.
                    If your campsite does not have a football pitch, you can still find one nearby.</p>

                    <h2>Outdoor cinema </h2>
                   <p>Contrary to what one might think, going to the cinema during the holidays is a very pleasant experience. The outdoor cinema allows you to see your favorite films in a special atmosphere while enjoying the beautiful summer weather. The atmosphere around open-air films is festive, friendly and relaxed. This is a perfect activity for a summer family outing during your camping vacation. Often the outdoor cinema goes with a picnic that you can put together as you wish. Charcuterie, cheeses, raw vegetables, sandwichesâ€¦ are welcome to forget the eternal popcorn of dark rooms.</p>
